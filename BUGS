from Steve Weber:

in the settings menu that shows the keyboard bindings, there are one or two settings that have the keyboard setting on the right and the in-game action on the left, while the others have the opposite. It's a continuity thing. I think all the keyboard settings should be on the left and the in game actions on the right.

Frequently I swing my sword at monsters (noticed mostly on the plant-creatures) and it does not register a hit. If I keep swinging by holding down the attack button it just walks right up to me unscathed. If I back off and attack from another angle/side, or attack another one then go back to the first, then I can hit it.

The Elf characters' bow does not make any sound when it fires or hits a wall, but I forget if it does on creatures.  I think a differing sound for both melee and ranged attacks against walls/objects that CANNOT be destoryed should make a different sound than ones that can.  This will give players an audible clue as to what they can smash/shoot through.
